# Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Pirate Intelligent Agent project, which was completed as part of a computer science course. The project focused on creating an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game using reinforcement learning and neural networks.

## Project Description

### Work Completed

In this project, I developed a Pirate Intelligent Agent for a treasure hunt game. The work included the following:

- Utilized starter code provided, including `TreasureMaze.py` and `GameExperience.py`, which defined the environment and stored game episodes.
- Implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm in the Jupyter Notebook `TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`.
- Designed algorithms to navigate a maze, balance exploration and exploitation, and train a neural network to make decisions based on experiences.
- Visualized the maze and the pirate's movements during training and testing.

### Connection to Computer Science

This project connects various computer science concepts:

- **Problem Solving**: Computer scientists approach complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components and designing efficient algorithms to solve them. In this project, I tackled the challenge of creating an intelligent agent for a game by designing and implementing algorithms for maze navigation and reinforcement learning.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: I applied reinforcement learning concepts to train the pirate agent. Rewards and penalties were used to guide the agent's actions and optimize its behavior over time.

- **Neural Networks**: Neural networks played a crucial role in approximating the Q-function, which enabled the pirate agent to make intelligent decisions based on experiences. Understanding neural networks and their applications is fundamental in the field of computer science.

- **Ethical Responsibilities**: Ethical considerations were integrated into the project, especially when designing the agent's behavior. Ensuring the agent's actions were fair and aligned with the game's objectives is an ethical responsibility in AI development. This reflects the broader ethical considerations in computer science.

## What Computer Scientists Do

Computer scientists play a pivotal role in various domains by using computational thinking and tools to solve complex problems. They:

- **Develop Solutions**: Computer scientists design and implement algorithms, data structures, and software applications to address real-world challenges, from optimizing business processes to creating intelligent game agents.

- **Drive Technological Advancements**: They drive technological advancements by pushing the boundaries of what is possible in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity.

- **Enhance Efficiency**: Computer scientists improve efficiency and productivity by automating tasks, streamlining workflows, and developing software solutions that save time and resources.

## Problem-Solving Approach

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically:

- **Analyze Problems**: I start by thoroughly analyzing the problem to gain a deep understanding of its requirements and constraints.

- **Decompose Tasks**: I break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks or sub-problems.

- **Design Algorithms**: I design efficient algorithms and data structures to solve each sub-problem.

- **Implement Solutions**: I implement solutions using programming languages and relevant tools, ensuring code quality and correctness.

- **Test and Optimize**: I rigorously test solutions, identify and debug issues, and optimize algorithms and code for performance.

## Ethical Responsibilities

As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations:

- **User Safety**: I must prioritize user safety, ensuring that the software and systems I develop do not pose harm or risks to users.

- **Data Privacy**: I am responsible for protecting user data and privacy, implementing secure data handling practices, and adhering to relevant regulations.

- **Fairness**: When developing AI systems, I must ensure fairness, avoiding biases and discrimination in algorithms and decision-making.

- **Transparency**: I should make systems transparent, enabling users to understand how their data is used and how algorithms work.

- **Organization's Interests**: I have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the organization I work for, including maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary information.

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in reinforcement learning and neural networks to create an intelligent agent. It highlighted the problem-solving skills, ethical responsibilities, and broader implications of computer science in solving real-world challenges.
